### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    
    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite lab because it was interesting to code a game like in C++, i learned how to put the correct values to the valid card by using the bool function to determine if it was true or false what card the user choose. Understanding that if the wrong value card was entered by the user I was able to prevent the user continuing with the game. It was also my first time coding the bool functions and setting the correct values for the valid cards. 

*Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2! The reason was because we were dealing with visual arts. I enjoy all the labs with animation and images. I thought it was cute to do a Halloween-themed lab, and it was my first time coding Animation using C++. I learned the meaning behind ASCII and ANSI.  I learned that it doesnâ€™t take a lot of coding to make an image that we did in lab 8. It was fun!

*Lab 12

    One of my favorite labs was Lab 12, part 1 because it was interesting to see how we combined animations using c++. I have always been fascinated by animation, and being able to mix up the colors to display it on the screen was fun to see the outcome.
